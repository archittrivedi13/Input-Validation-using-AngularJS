# Input-Validation-using-AngularJS
I have implemented an example of input validation using HTML5 and AngularJS.

This program is an example of implementing input validation using angularJS. It is developed using AngularJS, HTML5, CSS.

To run it, a text editor(preferably use Sublime Text) must be used and then it must be tested on any browser by running it on the same.
